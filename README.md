Problem statement -  A web-based mental health application designed to address the critical need for accessible mental health resources.(healthcare)

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. But people found it difficult to talk about it. We have seen that there are not many platforms which provide the right way to cure the problem, and the service is not available everywhere.

Scope of problem-
offers a solution by enabling users to find mental health professionals or therapists through an intuitive platform.
Our application will use data to match users with mental health professionals based on their preferences and needs.
The platform offers our users the convenience of booking appointments and attending video conferences with their mental health professional.
We will also provide a blog section for people to share useful information.
We will add a community chat section for people to connect.
