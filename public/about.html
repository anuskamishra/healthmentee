        <p class="text-lg py-10">HealthMentee is a web-based mental health application designed to address the critical need for accessible mental health resources. Mental health is an essential issue that demands attention, but many individuals find it challenging to speak about their struggles. HealthMentee offers a solution by enabling users to find mental health professionals or therapists through an intuitive platform. Our application uses data to match users with mental health professionals based on their preferences and needs. The platform offers users the convenience of booking appointments and attending video conferences with their mental health professional.

            HealthMentee also features an activity section where users can engage in different activities to improve their mental health. Additionally, our application has a blog section that provides useful information, insights, and resources to help users better understand their mental health.
            
            In the future, HealthMentee plans to add more features, such as a community chat function that enables users to connect with others who share similar experiences. HealthMentee is committed to providing a safe and inclusive space for all individuals seeking mental health support.</p>
